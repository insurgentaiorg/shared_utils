> in @shared_utils/clients/redis_client.py , I tried to refactor the client so that after i read a block of messages I could execute the callbacks for my 
  messages concurrently with asyncio. The actual execution of the callbacks per message would still run in sequence, but the messages could all be processed at
   the same time. I don't think my implementation is correct. Analyze and plan the corrections

✻ Thinking…

  The user has asked me to analyze and plan corrections for the implementation of concurrent callback execution in a Redis client using asyncio. I need to look
   at the current implementation to identify issues and propose fixes.

  Looking at the code in redis_client.py, I can see several issues with the current implementation:

  1. Mixing synchronous and asynchronous code incorrectly: 
    - In handle_messages_async, the code is trying to use asyncio.run() from within a non-async function. The asyncio.run() is designed to be used as an entry 
  point to asyncio programs, not from within an existing thread.
  2. Improper task creation:
    - The _create_async_message_task returns a coroutine function, not a task. Tasks should be created with asyncio.create_task() or similar.
  3. Assumption about callbacks being async:
    - The code in _create_async_message_task assumes all callbacks are async functions by using await cb(msg_id, val). However, there's no guarantee that the 
  callbacks registered are async functions.
  4. Missing acknowledgment:
    - In the async handling path, there's no call to self._client.xack() to acknowledge the message, which is present in the synchronous version.
  5. Thread safety concerns:
    - Using asyncio.run() in a thread is problematic and can lead to nested event loop errors.
  6. Redis client mismatch:
    - The code imports redis.asyncio but doesn't use it - it's using the synchronous Redis client.

  Let's plan the corrections:

  1. Create proper async/sync separation:
    - Either use synchronous Redis client consistently or switch to async Redis client fully.
    - If using async callbacks, ensure the main consumer loop is also async.
  2. Fix the async message handling:
    - Create a proper event loop for async operations if needed.
    - Use asyncio.gather properly to run multiple callbacks concurrently.
  3. Handle mixed callback types:
    - Add support for both sync and async callbacks.
    - Check if a callback is a coroutine function and handle it appropriately.
  4. Ensure message acknowledgment:
    - Add message acknowledgment after processing in the async path.
  5. Fix threading model:
    - Use a proper threading model that works with asyncio (e.g., run an async event loop in a dedicated thread).

  I'll now develop a plan to fix these issues.

     ☐ Plan proper solution for concurrent message processing
     ☐ Design corrected implementation with proper async handling

● I found several issues in the current implementation:

  1. Incorrect asyncio usage: asyncio.run() in line 155 is being called from within a thread, which isn't supported. This function is meant as an entry point
  for async programs.
  2. Callback compatibility issue: Line 161 uses await cb(msg_id, val), assuming all callbacks are coroutines, but the interface accepts any callable.
  3. Missing message acknowledgment: The async implementation doesn't acknowledge messages with xack() unlike the sync version (line 134).
  4. Event loop conflicts: Creating new event loops in threads can cause issues with event loop management.
  5. Inconsistent Redis client: Imports redis.asyncio but uses synchronous Redis client.

● Here's my proposed solution:

  1. Create a dedicated event loop per stream: Instead of using asyncio.run(), maintain a dedicated event loop for each stream consumer thread.
  2. Support both sync and async callbacks: Check if callbacks are coroutines and handle them appropriately.
  3. Properly acknowledge messages: Ensure messages are acknowledged after processing in both sync and async paths.
  4. Concurrent execution of callbacks: Use asyncio.gather() to run callbacks for all messages concurrently.

> this is actually how i want it to work. we may need to completely refactor the redis client to accomodate: The client is a singleton instance, same as now. 
  when someone calls register_callbacks they provide the stream, group, and callable function. The user will call a function that creates a consume loop on a 
  new thread for a particular redis stream. (so we have one consume loop operating on a thread for every stream we are watching). When creating the consume 
  loop there is a configurable parameter called max_block_read which dictates the maximum number of messages we can read from that stream at a time. Then they 
  call register callback with their desired function. Then the callback function gets added to that streams list of callbacks. When we finally read a block of 
  messages of a stream, we will create an async task for each message. Each task will be in charge of calling the registered callbacks for the stream on its 
  message, and then acknowledging the message. When we read messages from redis we will calculate how many messages we want to read from the stream with the 
  formula max_block_reads - running_tasks. So if we have 10 max_block_reads and 7 tasks are still running when we read the stream, we will read 3 tasks. 
  analyze this and come up with a plan. If there are critical logical flaws in this plan, then say so.

  The architecture is sound with a few implementation challenges to address:

  1. Task tracking mechanism: We need to track running tasks to implement the max_block_reads - running_tasks formula.
  2. Thread safety: Since we're tracking tasks across thread calls, we need thread-safe counters.
  3. Async callback execution: We need to properly manage async execution within each consumer thread.
  4. Error handling: If tasks fail, we need to ensure proper cleanup and error reporting.

> i dont think we will need to track tasks between different threads. the tasks will be running concurrently, so we should only need to track tasks on the 
  current consume loop thread. although there may be several consume loop threads running at one time, we dont care about tasks running for a different consume
   loop than the one we are currently in because that is for a different stream

✻ Thinking…

  The user has clarified that task tracking should be per consumer thread, not across threads. This simplifies the implementation. Let's adjust our 
  understanding:

  1. Each stream has its own consumer thread
  2. Each consumer thread has its own task tracking
  3. Tasks are only tracked within the thread that created them
  4. Task counting only matters for determining how many new messages to read from that specific stream

  This means we can localize the task tracking to each consume loop, rather than having a centralized tracking mechanism. This simplifies the design 
  significantly.

  Let me update my plan based on this clarification:

● You're absolutely right. Since each stream has its own dedicated consumer thread, we only need to track tasks within each consumer thread independently. This
   simplifies the implementation.

  Each consumer thread will:
  1. Maintain its own counter for running tasks
  2. Calculate message batch size based on its local counter
  3. Process messages concurrently within its own thread
  4. Not need to coordinate with other consumer threads

  This approach is cleaner and avoids cross-thread synchronization issues. Each stream consumer operates independently, with its own task tracking for proper
  backpressure.

> max_block_read should not be given when we register a callback. We want to have a new function that creates a consume loop thread. That function will have a 
  parameter max_block_read.

● I understand now. We'll separate the concerns:

  1. A new function to create a consumer thread for a specific stream with max_block_read parameter
  2. The existing register_callback function that adds callbacks to a stream

  This separation makes more sense architecturally - creating the consumer is distinct from registering callbacks, and the max_block_read belongs with the
  consumer creation.
                                                                                                                                        
●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  I'll implement a Redis client with separated consumer creation and callback registration:

     1. Add New Consumer Creation Function
       - Create new create_consumer(stream, group_id, max_block_read=10) method 
       - This function will initialize the consumer thread for a stream
       - The max_block_read parameter will control batch size dynamics
       - Handle creating Redis consumer groups if they don't exist
     2. Keep Existing Callback Registration
       - Maintain current register_callback(stream, group_id, callback) function
       - Check if consumer exists for the stream, create if needed (for backward compatibility)
       - Simply add the callback to the list of callbacks for that stream
     3. Implement Task-Aware Consumer Loop
       - Each consumer thread manages its own task counter
       - Calculate dynamic read size: max_block_read - running_tasks
       - Use a thread-local event loop for async operations
     4. Add Async Message Processing
       - Process messages concurrently using async tasks
       - Support both sync and async callbacks
       - Track task count to manage backpressure
       - Only acknowledge messages after all callbacks complete
     5. Handle Error Conditions
       - Graceful error handling for failed callbacks
       - Proper cleanup of tasks on errors
       - Ensure messages are acknowledged even if callbacks fail

     This implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding the new consumer creation function with max_block_read parameter.
